Welcome to my new webpage! This is the 4th version of a personal website I have created, and I think its here to stay.
## How it's made
The site is made using Hugo which is a static site generator using raw css.  
## My previous sites
Initially, I used Jekyll which is another static site generator, but there wasn't enough freedom for the styling in my opinion. That's what I deceided to learn React. 

React is a javascript framework which is very useful for building web apps and other javascript heavy websites, not a static site. Nevertheless, I decieded to make a static site generator with React. It was an average looking website and had a few interesting bells and whistles, but I didn't like it after a while and thought that minimal websites were the way to go.

The third site was better, but not the greatest, it was still made with React. I wrote a markdown reader to read markdown files from github and convert them to html when the page loaded. Not very good programming if you ask me, this was unnecessarily generating a ton of html everytime a user clicked on an article, it was slow and resource heavy.

The fourth site you are looking at right now, I decided after all this time, I should just try to use the best tool for the job and that happened to be Hugo. Hugo and Jekyll are very similar so I picked up Hugo pretty fast and all I can say is that I'm very happy with it. Fast, easy, and reliable make for a pretty good static site generator. 

## Web minimalism
I think its very important, especially for tech articles, that the site you host your writing on is very functional. That being said, the current state of the moderen web is filled with bloated javascript code trying to track users and promote advertisements.

With my last personal site, I used javascript when I did't need to. This caused longer loading times and since it was a .github.io domain, I was putting more stress than there needed to be on the github servers.
### Less is more
I eventually outlined all the features that I wanted in a personal website, and thought that according to occam's razor, the best solution is the simplest one. 

Stripping away all the unnecessary features of my old site and limiting the amount of bandwidth it took to load the site, I'm happy with the functionality per resource ratio. 
## Use the right tool
Hugo was the right tool all along, it has the customization that I'm looking for, and the lightweight functionality that I wanted to focus on. 

Even though it took many tries to get right, I still learned a lot about React along the way and have some projects in the works that use React (in the proper way).
